# The Google Keep Clone

A project built in The Javascript Bootcamp couse on Scrimba. A simple version of The Google Keep app with an ability to write notes, change their colors and delete notes.

Notes are saved in localStorage, so even if a user closes their browser, the notes are still there. Built with vanilla Javascript only with no libraries.

<h2>What next?</h2>

I'll come back to this project at some point to make the code even easier to read by separating functions to different files and importing then back to app.js
